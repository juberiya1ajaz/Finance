<h2>Environment:</h2>
<li>Python
<li>Flask
<li>bootstrap
<li>HTML and css
<li>It also uses  <a href="https://iextrading.com/developer">IEX</a>
to get the stocks values in real time and a SQL database to store users information, such as username, 
a hash of the password, the stocks they bought or sold and the history.
<h2>Introduction</h2>

 
The project proposes the following:<br>
Implemented a web application that enables the user can "buy" and "sell" stocks, following the criteria below:
<ol><li>implementation of registeration in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.
<li> implementation of quote in such a way that it allows a user to look up a stock’s current price.
<li> implementation of buy in such a way that it enables a user to buy stocks.
<li> implementation of sell in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).
<li>implementation of index in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user’s current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks' total value plus cash).
<li> implementation of history in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.
<li> implementation of check in such a way that  it checks whether a username is unavailable or not.
